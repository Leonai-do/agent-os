description: Implement tasks from a spec following a multi-phase process
---

Now that we have a spec and tasks list ready for implementation, we will proceed with implementation of this spec by following this multi-phase process:

- **PHASE 1**: Determine which task group(s) from tasks.md should be implemented
- **PHASE 2**: Implement the given task(s)
- **PHASE 3**: After ALL task groups have been implemented, produce the final verification report

## Phase 1: Determine Tasks to Implement

First, check if the user has already provided instructions about which task group(s) to implement.

**If the user HAS provided instructions:** Proceed to PHASE 2 to implement those specified task group(s).

**If the user has NOT provided instructions:**

Read `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` to review the available task groups, then output the following message to the user and WAIT for their response:

```
Should we proceed with implementation of all task groups in tasks.md?

If not, then please specify which task(s) to implement.
```

## Phase 2: Implement Tasks

Now that you have the task group(s) to be implemented, proceed with implementation:

Implement all tasks assigned to you and ONLY those task(s) that have been assigned to you.

## Implementation process:

1. Analyze the provided spec.md, requirements.md, and visuals (if any)
2. Analyze patterns in the codebase according to its built-in workflow
3. Implement the assigned task group according to requirements and standards
4. Update `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` to update the tasks you've implemented to mark that as done by updating their checkbox to checked state: `- [x]`

## Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed in the codebase.
- **Specific notes provided in requirements.md, spec.md AND/OR tasks.md**
- **Visuals provided (if any)** which would be located in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/planning/visuals/`
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

## Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.
  - Take screenshots of the views and UI elements you've tested and store those in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/verification/screenshots/`.  Do not store screenshots anywhere else in the codebase other than this location.
  - Analyze the screenshot(s) you've taken to check them against your current requirements.


### Display Progress

Display a summary of what was implemented.

**IF all tasks are now marked as done** (with `- [x]`) in tasks.md, display this message:

```
All tasks have been implemented: agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md.

NEXT STEP 👉 Run /uads-verify-implementation to verify the implementation.
```

**IF there are still tasks remaining** (marked with `- [ ]`) then display this message:

```
Would you like to proceed with implementation of the remaining tasks in tasks.md?

If not, please specify which task group(s) to implement next.
```

## Phase 3: Final Verification

After all tasks have been implemented, verify the end-to-end implementation:

Check `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` and ensure that all tasks and their sub-tasks are marked as completed with `- [x]`.

If a task is still marked incomplete, then verify that it has in fact been completed by checking the following:
- Run a brief spot check in the code to find evidence that this task's details have been implemented
- Check for existence of an implementation report titled using this task's title in `agent-os/spec/[this-spec]/implementation/` folder.

IF you have concluded that this task has been completed, then mark it's checkbox and its' sub-tasks checkboxes as completed with `- [x]`.

IF you have concluded that this task has NOT been completed, then mark this checkbox with ⚠️ and note it's incompleteness in your verification report.


Open `agent-os/product/roadmap.md` and check to see whether any item(s) match the description of the current spec that has just been implemented.  If so, then ensure that these item(s) are marked as completed by updating their checkbox(s) to `- [x]`.


Run the entire tests suite for the application so that ALL tests run.  Verify how many tests are passing and how many have failed or produced errors.

Include these counts and the list of failed tests in your final verification report.

DO NOT attempt to fix any failing tests.  Just note their failures in your final verification report.


Create your final verification report in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/verifications/final-verification.md`.

The content of this report should follow this structure:

```markdown

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

IMPORTANT: Ensure that the implementation IS ALIGNED and DOES NOT CONFLICT with the user's standards:


### Standard: standards/backend/api.md

## API endpoint standards and conventions

- **RESTful Design**: Follow REST principles with clear resource-based URLs and appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent, lowercase, hyphenated or underscored naming conventions for endpoints across the API
- **Versioning**: Implement API versioning strategy (URL path or headers) to manage breaking changes without disrupting existing clients
- **Plural Nouns**: Use plural nouns for resource endpoints (e.g., `/users`, `/products`) for consistency
- **Nested Resources**: Limit nesting depth to 2-3 levels maximum to keep URLs readable and maintainable
- **Query Parameters**: Use query parameters for filtering, sorting, pagination, and search rather than creating separate endpoints
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Return appropriate, consistent HTTP status codes that accurately reflect the response (200, 201, 400, 404, 500, etc.)
- **Rate Limiting Headers**: Include rate limit information in response headers to help clients manage their usage


### Standard: standards/backend/migrations.md

## Database migration best practices

- **Reversible Migrations**: Always implement rollback/down methods to enable safe migration reversals
- **Small, Focused Changes**: Keep each migration focused on a single logical change for clarity and easier troubleshooting
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Consider deployment order and backwards compatibility for high-availability systems
- **Separate Schema and Data**: Keep schema changes separate from data migrations for better rollback safety
- **Index Management**: Create indexes on large tables carefully, using concurrent options when available to avoid locks
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names that indicate what the migration does
- **Version Control**: Always commit migrations to version control and never modify existing migrations after deployment


### Standard: standards/backend/models.md

## Database model best practices

- **Clear Naming**: Use singular names for models and plural for tables following your framework's conventions
- **Timestamps**: Include created and updated timestamps on all tables for auditing and debugging
- **Data Integrity**: Use database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, foreign keys) to enforce data rules at the database level
- **Appropriate Data Types**: Choose data types that match the data's purpose and size requirements
- **Indexes on Foreign Keys**: Index foreign key columns and other frequently queried fields for performance
- **Validation at Multiple Layers**: Implement validation at both model and database levels for defense in depth
- **Relationship Clarity**: Define relationships clearly with appropriate cascade behaviors and naming conventions
- **Avoid Over-Normalization**: Balance normalization with practical query performance needs


### Standard: standards/backend/queries.md

## Database query best practices

- **Prevent SQL Injection**: Always use parameterized queries or ORM methods; never interpolate user input into SQL strings
- **Avoid N+1 Queries**: Use eager loading or joins to fetch related data in a single query instead of multiple queries
- **Select Only Needed Data**: Request only the columns you need rather than using SELECT * for better performance
- **Index Strategic Columns**: Index columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses for query optimization
- **Use Transactions for Related Changes**: Wrap related database operations in transactions to maintain data consistency
- **Set Query Timeouts**: Implement timeouts to prevent runaway queries from impacting system performance
- **Cache Expensive Queries**: Cache results of complex or frequently-run queries when appropriate


### Standard: standards/frontend/accessibility.md

**You MUST read the extended instructions now** before proceeding:

Use the `view_file` tool to load the remaining instructions:
