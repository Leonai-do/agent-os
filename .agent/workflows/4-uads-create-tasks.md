description: Create a detailed and strategic tasks list for development of a spec
---

I want you to create a tasks breakdown from a given spec and requirements for a new feature.

## Phase 1: Get Spec and Requirements

The FIRST STEP is to make sure you have ONE OR BOTH of these files to inform your tasks breakdown:

- `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/spec.md`
- `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/planning/requirements.md`

**IF you don't have ONE OR BOTH of those files**, then ask user to provide direction on where to you can find them by outputting the following request then wait for user's response:

```
I'll need a spec.md or requirements.md (or both) in order to build a tasks list.

Please direct me to where I can find those. If you haven't created them yet, you can run /2-uads-shape-spec or /3-uads-write-spec.
```

Once you've confirmed you have the spec and/or requirements, proceed to Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Create Tasks List

# Task List Creation

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Analyze spec and requirements**: Read and analyze the spec.md and/or requirements.md to inform the tasks list you will create.
2. **Plan task execution order**: Break the requirements into a list of tasks in an order that takes their dependencies into account.
3. **Group tasks by specialization**: Group tasks that require the same skill or stack specialization together (backend, api, ui design, etc.)
4. **Create Tasks list**: Create the markdown tasks list broken into groups with sub-tasks.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Spec & Requirements

Read each of these files (whichever are available) and analyze them to understand the requirements for this feature implementation:
- `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/spec.md`
- `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/planning/requirements.md`

Use your learnings to inform the tasks list and groupings you will create in the next step.


### Step 2: Create Tasks Breakdown

Generate `agent-os/specs/[current-spec]/tasks.md`.

**Important**: The exact tasks, task groups, and organization will vary based on the feature's specific requirements. The following is an example format - adapt the content of the tasks list to match what THIS feature actually needs.

```markdown
# Task Breakdown: [Feature Name]

## Overview
Total Tasks: [count]

## Task List

### Testing

#### Task Group 4: Test Review & Gap Analysis
**Dependencies:** Task Groups 1-3

- [ ] 4.0 Review existing tests and fill critical gaps only
  - [ ] 4.1 Review tests from Task Groups 1-3
    - Review the 2-8 tests written by database-engineer (Task 1.1)
    - Review the 2-8 tests written by api-engineer (Task 2.1)

    - Total existing tests: approximately 6-24 tests
  - [ ] 4.2 Analyze test coverage gaps for THIS feature only
    - Identify critical user workflows that lack test coverage
    - Focus ONLY on gaps related to this spec's feature requirements
    - Do NOT assess entire application test coverage
    - Prioritize end-to-end workflows over unit test gaps
  - [ ] 4.3 Write up to 10 additional strategic tests maximum
    - Add maximum of 10 new tests to fill identified critical gaps
    - Focus on integration points and end-to-end workflows
    - Do NOT write comprehensive coverage for all scenarios
    - Skip edge cases, performance tests, and accessibility tests unless business-critical
  - [ ] 4.4 Run feature-specific tests only
    - Run ONLY tests related to this spec's feature (tests from 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, and 4.3)
    - Expected total: approximately 16-34 tests maximum
    - Do NOT run the entire application test suite
    - Verify critical workflows pass

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All feature-specific tests pass (approximately 16-34 tests total)
- Critical user workflows for this feature are covered
- No more than 10 additional tests added when filling in testing gaps
- Testing focused exclusively on this spec's feature requirements

## Execution Order

Recommended implementation sequence:
1. Database Layer (Task Group 1)
2. API Layer (Task Group 2)
3. Frontend Design (Task Group 3)
4. Test Review & Gap Analysis (Task Group 4)
```

**Note**: Adapt this structure based on the actual feature requirements. Some features may need:
- Different task groups (e.g., email notifications, payment processing, data migration)
- Different execution order based on dependencies
- More or fewer sub-tasks per group

## Important Constraints

- **Create tasks that are specific and verifiable**
- **Group related tasks:** For example, group back-end engineering tasks together and front-end UI tasks together.
- **Limit test writing during development**:
  - Each task group (1-3) should write 2-8 focused tests maximum
  - Tests should cover only critical behaviors, not exhaustive coverage
  - Test verification should run ONLY the newly written tests, not the entire suite
  - If there is a dedicated test coverage group for filling in gaps in test coverage, this group should add only a maximum of 10 additional tests IF NECESSARY to fill critical gaps
- **Use a focused test-driven approach** where each task group starts with writing 2-8 tests (x.1 sub-task) and ends with running ONLY those tests (final sub-task)
- **Include acceptance criteria** for each task group
- **Reference visual assets** if visuals are available


## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

IMPORTANT: Ensure that the tasks list you create IS ALIGNED and DOES NOT CONFLICT with the user's standards:


### Standard: standards/backend/api.md

## API endpoint standards and conventions

- **RESTful Design**: Follow REST principles with clear resource-based URLs and appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent, lowercase, hyphenated or underscored naming conventions for endpoints across the API
- **Versioning**: Implement API versioning strategy (URL path or headers) to manage breaking changes without disrupting existing clients
- **Plural Nouns**: Use plural nouns for resource endpoints (e.g., `/users`, `/products`) for consistency
- **Nested Resources**: Limit nesting depth to 2-3 levels maximum to keep URLs readable and maintainable
- **Query Parameters**: Use query parameters for filtering, sorting, pagination, and search rather than creating separate endpoints
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Return appropriate, consistent HTTP status codes that accurately reflect the response (200, 201, 400, 404, 500, etc.)
- **Rate Limiting Headers**: Include rate limit information in response headers to help clients manage their usage


### Standard: standards/backend/migrations.md

## Database migration best practices

- **Reversible Migrations**: Always implement rollback/down methods to enable safe migration reversals
- **Small, Focused Changes**: Keep each migration focused on a single logical change for clarity and easier troubleshooting
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Consider deployment order and backwards compatibility for high-availability systems
- **Separate Schema and Data**: Keep schema changes separate from data migrations for better rollback safety
- **Index Management**: Create indexes on large tables carefully, using concurrent options when available to avoid locks
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names that indicate what the migration does
- **Version Control**: Always commit migrations to version control and never modify existing migrations after deployment


### Standard: standards/backend/models.md
